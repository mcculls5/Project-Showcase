# Overview
This repository is a centralized list of many of my past projects. 

The purpose of this list is to document my experience rather than to host working versions of the projects. Since many project are related to classwork, some code must be omitted.

# Highlights

## [Physiological Visualization Research](https://github.com/mcculls5/Project-Showcase/tree/master/Physiological_Visualization_Research)
This research project explored the use of data visualization techniques to identify challenges faced by college students on the autism spectrum. As my undergraduate capstone project, I gained many fundamental skills of data analysis and visualization. Through my work on this project, I learned how to use visualization to identify novel insights in large datasets.
## [Convolutional Neural Network Exploration](https://github.com/mcculls5/Project-Showcase/tree/master/CNN_Exploration)
Through this assignment, I gained a deep understanding of CNNs by interacting with them in unconventional ways. This included visualizing the activations of a CNN and intentionally fooling AlexNet.
## [Protein Energy/Rigidity Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/mcculls5/Project-Showcase/tree/master/Protein_Energy_and_Rigidity)
In this research-oriented project, I worked in an interdisciplinary group of Biology and Computer Science students to design predictive metrics of the effects of protein mutations. This greatly improved my teamwork and large-scale data management skills.
