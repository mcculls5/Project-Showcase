# Projects

## Overview
This repository is a centralized list of many of my past projects. 

The purpose of this list is to document my experience rather than to host working versions of the projects. Since many project are related to classwork, some code must be omitted.

## Highlights
### Physiological Visualization Research
This research project explored the use of data visualization techniques to identify challenges faced by college students on the autism spectrum. As my undergraduate capstone project, I gained many fundamental skills of data analysis and visualization. Through my work on this project, I learned how to use visualization to identify novel insights in large datasets.
### Convolutional Neural Network Exploration
In this final assignment for my graduate computer vision class, I gained a deep understanding of CNNs by interacting with them in unconventional ways. This included visualizing the activations of a CNN and intentionally fooling AlexNet.
### Protein Energy/Rigidity Analysis and Visualization
In this research-oriented project, I worked in an interdisciplinary group of Biology and Computer Science students to explore potential predictive metrics of the effects single point mutations have on the properies of a protein.
