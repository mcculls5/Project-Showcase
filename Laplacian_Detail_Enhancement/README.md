# Laplacian Detail Enhancement

![Enhanced Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcculls5/Project-Showcase/master/Laplacian_Detail_Enhancement/laplacian.jpg)

## Overview
Implemented the construction of a Laplacian pyramid, with variable weights for each level of the pyramid. This allows for modifying images by increasing or decreasing the prevalence of sharp and soft features.
