# Convolutional Networks

## Overview
Used Google Colab and PyTorch for the following:
- Implemented a visualization of AlexNet structure and its activations.  
- Implemented a binary classifier of dogs vs. food. 
- Visualized class saliency to gain insight on the pixels that were most important in determining class prediction. The class saliency information was then used to fool AlexNet into making wrong predictions. 
- Visualized a learned class.
- Implemented a neural net to train on MNIST dataset. Achieved 99% accuracy with a constraint of 50000 parameters by using Max-pooling, batch normalizations, residual connections between non-adjacent layers, and multiple fully-connected linear layers.
