# Visualizing High Performance Computing (HPC)

## Overview
A few visualizations were created as an exploration into the use of data visualization in the domain of high performance computing. These visualizations were created using anonymized data provided by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

- **dataset.csv** : Anonymized data used to generate the visualizations.
- **Node Performance.png** : An simple visualization of node performance. Highlights the disparity of performance throughout the cluster.
- **Node Usage.png** : An interactive heatmap visualization of node usage. May help to identify improvements for the cluster's scheduling algorithm.
- **Parallel Coordinates.png** : An interactive parallel coordinates visualization to help identify correlations between various metrics.
