## Overview
Used Google Colab and PyTorch for the following:
- Implemented a visualization of AlexNet's structure and its activations.  
- Implemented a binary classifier of dogs vs. food. 
- Visualized class saliency to gain insight on the pixels that were most important in determining class prediction. The class saliency information was then used to fool AlexNet into making incorrect predictions. 
- Visualized a learned class.
- Implemented a CNN to train on the MNIST dataset. Achieved 99% accuracy with a constraint of 50000 parameters by using Max-pooling, batch normalizations, residual connections, and multiple fully-connected linear layers.
