Sean McCulloch's plane sweep stereo extension

extended_plane_sweep_stereo.py is a modification of the provided plane_sweep_stereo.py


The modifications were made as part of the CSCI597P extension portion of P3.

The extension aims to improve the results of the plane sweep stereo algorithm by reducing 
erroneous noise in the depth estimations.

This is done by comparing the the solution of each pixel (solution being the argmax of the cost volume)
with surrounding solutions. If the pixel's solution is determined to be an outlier relative to its neighbors, its
solution is replaced by the mean of the surrounding solutions. The size of the patch of surrounding solutions 
which are used to calculated the mean and determine outlier status is determined by sys.argv[2]

Outliers are determined by the solution's Z-score, with the threshold of sys.argv[3].

Usage:
python ./extended_plane_sweep_stereo.py <dataset> <mean-patch-size> <std-threshold>

Example
python ./extended_plane_sweep_stereo.py tentacle 11 2


This modification is entirely contained in the clean_outlier_noise() function.
This function is called on the solution matrix, directly after it is created by the argmax call.

This extended algorithm was run on the datasets: tentacle Flowers Bycicle1 Couch. The example parameters (11, 2) were used with all of these datasets.

Side-by-side comparisons can be seen in results.pdf

While the difference is not dramatic, the modification did remove some small patches of noise. This effect is most obvious in the tentacle dataset. This may be a result of choosing parameters that were effective for the tentacle dataset during testing.
