## Overview
Efficiently implemented 2D cross-correlation and convolution algorithms. This was used with high frequency and low frequency filters to combine images into a single hybrid image.

## Skills & Experience Gained
- Thorough knowlege of convolution, cross correlation algorithms.
- Experience using numpy and opencv-python libraries.
- Improved proficiency with python.
